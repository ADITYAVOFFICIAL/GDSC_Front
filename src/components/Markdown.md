1. **Imports**: The code starts with several import statements. These imports bring in necessary libraries and components for the markdown editor functionality. For example:
   - `React` is imported to create React components.
   - `useState` is imported from React to manage state within functional components.
   - Various icons and components are imported from different libraries such as `react-icons`, `react-copy-to-clipboard`, and `react-hot-toast`.

2. **Toolbar Component**: The `Toolbar` component is a set of buttons that allow users to insert markdown syntax into the editor. Each button represents a different markdown feature like headings, bold, italic, links, images, and code blocks. These buttons trigger the `insertText` function with specific markdown syntax when clicked.

3. **MarkdownEditor Component**: This is the main component responsible for rendering the markdown editor and previewer side by side. It consists of:
   - **State Management**: It initializes the markdown state using `useState` hook, setting a default markdown content.
   - **Event Handlers**: Functions like `handleMarkdownChange` for updating the markdown state when the user types in the editor and `handleCopy` for copying the markdown content to the clipboard.
   - **Insert Text Function**: This function is responsible for inserting markdown syntax into the editor at the current cursor position.
   - **Components Object**: This object defines custom rendering for certain markdown elements such as headings, links, lists, etc. It customizes how these elements are displayed in the previewer.
   - **Rendering**: It renders the editor and previewer side by side. The editor allows users to input markdown text, while the previewer displays the rendered HTML output.
   - **Copy Button**: A button is included to copy the markdown content to the clipboard. It uses the `CopyToClipboard` component from `react-copy-to-clipboard`.

4. **Export**: The `MarkdownEditor` component is exported as the default export of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
